OI / AI Buddy.

Suggest context based on free text input. Contexts are pre-defined against some keywords. (AI logic is inspired from parent Linnaeus gem)

Linnaeus is a redis-backed naive Bayesian classification system. Please see the [rdoc](http://rubydoc.info/gems/linnaeus/) for more information. Ruby 1.9 is required.

Examples
--------

    lt = Linnaeus::Trainer.new      # Used to train documents
    lc = Linnaeus::Classifier.new   # Used to classify documents

    lt.train 'language', 'Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, general-purpose object-oriented programming language that combines syntax inspired by Perl with Smalltalk-like features.'
    lt.train 'database', 'PostgreSQL, often simply Postgres, is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) available for many platforms including Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.'

    lc.classify 'Perl is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.' # returns "language"
